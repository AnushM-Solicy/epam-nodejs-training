Rewrite the 2nd task (csv parsing) using worker threads.
It would be pretty easy for you once you have implemented
 it with clusters.
For this task, however, consider the following differences:
The number of workers should not be greater than 10,
Try restructuring your code (switch to OOP or functional 
if the other was used for the previous task).
Keep using promises (practice promisification).
Please, note that the students who did not submit the
2nd task or implemented it incorrectly should submit
it along with this task.

Good luck!
