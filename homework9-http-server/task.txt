Extend your existing CSV to JSON converter script to create an HTTP server using the 'http' module. The server should listen on a specific port for incoming HTTP requests. Implement the following routes to handle CRUD operations:
Route 1: POST '/exports': Convert and save all the CSV files in the given directory (get directory path from request body).
Route 2: GET '/files': Retrieve a list of all available converted JSON files.
Route 3: GET '/files/:filename': Retrieve a specific JSON data by its filename.
Route 4: DELETE '/files/:filename': Delete a specific JSON file by its filename.
Important to note!
Handle any errors gracefully and provide appropriate error messages if necessary.
Test your server by sending HTTP requests to the defined routes using a tool like cURL or a web browser or Postman.
Keep your code structured and clean.
